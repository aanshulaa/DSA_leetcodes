# Peak element in Array
Problem Statement: Given an array of length N. Peak element is defined as the element greater than both of its neighbors. Formally, if ‘arr[i]’ is the peak element, ‘arr[i – 1]’ < ‘arr[i]’ and ‘arr[i + 1]’ < ‘arr[i]’. Find the index(0-based) of a peak element in the array. If there are multiple peak numbers, return the index of any peak number.
