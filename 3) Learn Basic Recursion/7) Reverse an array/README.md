#  Reverse an Array

Sample Input 1:
8
3 1 1 7 4 2 6 11

Sample Output 1:
11 6 2 4 7 1 1 3    

Explanation Of Sample Input 1 :
After reversing the array, it looks like this [11, 6, 2, 4, 7, 1, 1, 3].

Sample Input 2:
4
8 1 3 2
Sample Output 2:
2 3 1 8

Explanation Of Sample Input 2 :
After reversing the array, it looks like this [2, 3, 1, 8].

Expected time complexity

The expected time complexity is O(n).
Constraints:
1 <= 'n' <= 10^6
