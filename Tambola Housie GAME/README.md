# Tambola Housie GAME 

Here's a simple Python code to generate numbers for a game of Tambola (also known as Housie or Bingo). This code assumes the standard Tambola rules where each ticket has a 3x9 grid and numbers are drawn one by one until a player completes a row, column, or diagonal.

This code defines a TambolaGame class with a method generate_random_number to generate a random number from the remaining numbers. You can customize and extend this code based on your specific requirements for displaying numbers, managing player tickets, and checking for winning conditions.
